# The South of England Regional Programming Languages Seminar (S-REPLS)

##Â About

The South of England Regional Programming Language Seminar (S-REPLS) is a
regular and informal meeting for those based in the South of England with a
professional interest &mdash; whether it be academic or commercial &mdash; in
the semantics and implementation of programming languages.

S-REPLS moves around the South of England, and relies on the generosity of
volunteers.  Meetings are always free to attend.

S-REPLS was initially organised by Ohad Kammar, Dominic Mulligan, and Jeremy
Yallop, with the first meeting held at the Computer Laboratory, University of
Cambridge.  Ohad, Dominic, and Jeremy have subsequently acted as an organization
committee, arranging continued meetings.  Note that decisions about the format
and programme of any given meeting are made by the local meeting organizers.
