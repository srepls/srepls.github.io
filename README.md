# The South of England Regional Programming Languages Seminar (S-REPLS)

## About

The South of England Regional Programming Language Seminar (S-REPLS) is a
regular and informal meeting for those based in the South of England with a
professional interest &mdash; whether it be academic or commercial &mdash; in
the semantics and implementation of programming languages.

Southern England has a substantial community of people with an interest in
programming language theory (PLT).  However, away from the field’s large
academic conferences there are currently limited opportunities for interaction,
discussion and proliferation of new ideas, or networking within this community.
With S-REPLS we are remedying that.

S-REPLS is based on the *Scottish Programming Languages Seminar (SPLS)*, a
similar informal yet regular meeting of like-minded souls in Scotland.  SPLS is
well attended and widely anticipated by the PLT community in Scotland, and we
hope that S-REPLS will continue to be too.

S-REPLS moves around the South of England, and relies on the generosity of
volunteers.  Meetings are always free to attend.

S-REPLS was initially organised by Ohad Kammar, Dominic Mulligan, and Jeremy
Yallop, with the first meeting held at the Computer Laboratory, University of
Cambridge.  Ohad, Dominic, and Jeremy have subsequently acted as an organization
committee, arranging continued meetings.  Note that decisions about the format
and programme of any given meeting are made by the local meeting organizers.
